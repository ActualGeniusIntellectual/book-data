   > Most regulatory cases were more like the Leonard case than like Lochner. It is, in fact, too simple-minded to portray the justices as frightened, reactionary men, defending a dying social order. They were not cardboard conservatives. In their decisions, they seemed to wobble this way or that. What they feared the most, it seems, was excess. They had little or no understanding of what it was like to work in a factory or a sweatshop; and they were terrified of radical winds blowing  in  from  across  the  Atlantic.  But  they  did  not  shrink  from  moderate reform.  They  were  perfectly  willing  to  uphold  some  regulation  of  business,  if they considered it necessary for this or that reason. Their instincts were not so much reactionary as soundly upper middle class.

   > There  were  so  many  decisions  passing  judgment  on  state  (and  federal) statutes that it is hard to sum them up in any simple formula. But as this case indicates,  judges  did,  at  times,  seem  to  exercise  a  veto  over  legislation—as  if they were something like super state governors.

   > Ernst Freund, writing in 1904, was surely right when he pointed to the ''vast amount of police legislation''—that is, laws on public safety and health—and observed that, under modern conditions, the  state  ''was  readily  conceded  more  incisive  powers  than  despotic  governments would have dared to claim in former times.

   > Government has, of course, always had to raise money to pay for its activities. But governments in the nineteenth century did so much less than they do today; from the modern standpoint, their tax bite was as soft as a kiss. The revenues of the federal government in the nineteenth century were on a scale so low that they seem ludicrous today.

   > The Supreme Court was equally cavalier about section 20 of the Clayton Act.  In  1921,  in  a  case  involving  a  secondary  boycott,  the  Court  essentially reduced section 20 to empty words. The section, according to the Court, was not intended to change existing law.∞∞π Later cases bolstered this interpretation.

 * Page #89:
   > As Felix Frankfurter and Nathan Greene remarked, the Clayton Act ''came as clay  into  the  hands  of  the  federal  courts'';  and  they  made  the  act  into  an antiunion instrument—turning it, in a way, on its head: ''The more things are legislatively changed, the more they remain the same judicially.''

   > But labor was not without political power; some states passed laws, in one form or another, against labor injunctions, or exempting unions from antitrust suits  and  the  charge  of  restraint  of  trade.  These  laws,  too,  fared  badly  in  the courts. Many of them were declared null and void. The Supreme Court took a similar attitude in Truax v. Corrigan (1921).∞∞Ω The statute here was Arizona's; and  the  case  involved  a  restaurant  called  the  English  Kitchen  in  Bisbee.  The workers had gone on strike, and were picketing the restaurant. The picketing was  successful—business  dropped  o√  dramatically.  A  bare  majority  of  the Supreme  Court,  speaking  through  Chief  Justice  Taft,  invalidated  the  Arizona statute that allowed peaceful picketing and forbade injunctions. Business, said Taft, was ''property,'' and the scurrilous, libelous acts of the picketers destroyed ''property'' in a way that the state could not condone.

   > Even  statutes  that  survived  judicial  attack  were,  according  to  William  E. Forbath,  ''vitiated  by  narrow  construction.''∞≤≠  Nonetheless,  the  days  of  the labor injunction were numbered. In 1930 President Hoover nominated Judge John J. Parker to be a justice of the Supreme Court. Parker, a southern Republican,  had  issued  a  labor  injunction  in  1927  against  the  United  Mine  Workers. The American Federation of Labor mounted a campaign against Parker; and on May 7, 1930, the Senate rejected him, by a vote of 41–39—a rare event indeed. By this time the labor injunction was doomed; it was too unpopular, politically. In 1932 President Hoover signed the Norris–La Guardia bill, which had passed both houses with huge majorities, and which was meant to put an end to the labor injunction, once and for all.

 * Page #89:
   > The labor injunction had terrorized organized labor for some forty years. Some  scholars  think  that  the  crushing  impact  of  legal  repression—the  labor injunction  was  an  important  aspect  of  this  repression—fundamentally  altered the character of the American labor movement. Mossbacks on the bench not only  inflicted  ''irreparable  injury''  on  this  or  that  union,  strike,  or  item  on labor's wish list; they seduced the movement (or coerced it) into a ''negative and anti-statist'' mode. British courts, of course, were just as reactionary, if not more so; but they did not have the power to strike down acts of Parliament—and this was a crucial di√erence. In the United States, organized labor faced an implaca

 * Page #90:
   > ble  and  powerful  bench.  Hence,  like  a  person  condemned  to  die  in  the  gas chamber, labor developed a one-track legal mind, an obsession which sucked all  of  its  energies  into  the  search  for  an  end  to  the  ''judge-made  regime''  of repression, and drew it away from broader goals—such as the formation of a labor party, of the type which flourished in Europe.

 * Page #90:
   > Whether this reasoning is right or wrong—and in what proportions—is not easy to say. It is true that some segments of the labor movement lost their radical edge, if they had ever had one. David Dubinsky, of the—ostensibly socialist— International  Ladies  Garment  Workers  Union  remarked  that  ''unions  need capitalism  like  a  fish  needs  water.''  Workers  needed  jobs;  their  livelihood  depended on profits and economic growth. It was a matter of survival.∞

 * Page #90:
   > Moreover,  the  states  did  pass  a  good  deal  of  prounion  legislation.  Minnesota, for example, outlawed blacklists and yellow-dog contracts in the early years of the twentieth century.∞≤∂ A great many of these prolabor statutes either never  got  challenged  in  court  or  withstood  challenges.  Not  all  courts  were antiunion; and, indeed, the legal climate for labor unions got distinctly better in the  early  years  of  the  century;  the  New  Deal,  in  the  1930s,  was  openly  and blatantly prounion, and much of the union program got translated into law.

   > Patriotism and conformity were also major needs of the war period, at least as the government saw it. The modern law of civil liberties, as we shall see, got a jump start from World War I—though this was in reaction to grim and repressive laws, including laws on ''sedition.'' The war created, as war always does, a sense of emergency; and led to a vast expansion of the authority of the central government.

 * Page #91:
   > The Lever Act of 1917 gave the president almost dictatorial power over food and fuel.∞≤π President Wilson (with rather dubious legal and constitutional  authority)  seized  control  of  all  the  railroads  and  water  transportation systems,  everything  except  local  streetcar  lines—an  extraordinary  move.  But Congress ratified the president's action, and passed a statute giving him almost uncontrolled discretion to deal with the roads, including the right to enter into agreements  about  their  income,  taxes,  and  the  way  they  maintained  themselves.∞≤∫ The government later seized control of telegraph and cable lines.

   > Every year there were sensational trials of this type—often involving jealousy, love triangles, and the like; trials filled with darkly sexual innuendo. They were  lush  dramas,  embroidered  with  juicy  details  (some  of  them  fake)  in  the daily press. These trials satisfied some deep-seated hunger of the bourgeoisie. The newspapers clucked and scolded and pretended to be appalled; but these sordid a√airs gave o√ the rotting perfume of forbidden fruit. In the age of TV, worse was yet to come.

 * Page #107:
   > From  time  to  time,  a  muckraker  like  Burns  ripped  open  the  walls,  so  to speak, and showed the horror of life inside the prison system. Another of these was Kate Barnard, who in 1908 exposed massive brutalities and inhumanities in the Kansas prison system: floggings, water torture, confinement in a chamber called the ''crib.'' ''Sodomists and masturbators'' had to submit to a ''surgical operation''  in  which  a  ''brass  ring  was  inserted  through  the  foreskin  of  an o√ender's  penis.''  But  the  public  was  indi√erent;  and  the  response  of  the governor  of  Kansas  was  perhaps  typical:  ''Kate  would  like  to  see  the  prisoners . . . treated as if they were guests at the Waldorf Astoria.''

   > America is said to su√er from (or glory in) a ''Puritan'' tradition; but any such statement has to be taken with a large grain of salt. The Puritans, after all, are long  since  gone;  and  not  many  living  Americans  are  their  descendants—far more of them come from very di√erent backgrounds and cultures. Puritan ideas about vice, pleasure, sexuality have passed into history. In fact, the story of the war  on  vice  is  full  of  zigs  and  zags.  In  the  early  nineteenth  century,  the  war sputtered to a halt, or was, at best, reduced from a boil to a simmer. At the end of the nineteenth century, there was an eruption or outburst of new morality—a flock of new laws heating up the war against sin and debauchery.

 * Page #111:
   > Was there any truth to the hysteria over white slavery? Some, no doubt. But not a great deal. It was certainly right to worry about the sexual oppression of women;  and  about  syphilis  and  gonorrhea.  Yet  perhaps  the  most  important problem  underlying  the  ''social  evil''  was  the  economic  inequity  that  faced women in big cities. Many women turned to prostitution on their own, without any hypodermic needles or drugs; they were desperate for money. This was a hard idea to swallow—especially in the light of traditional notions of the purity and innocence of women. The white-slave propaganda shifted the blame from the economy to evil, sinister, dark-haired men, who preyed on naive, virtuous women and ruined their lives. Outrage over these villains was more comfortable than outrage over what shopgirls took home as their pay.

 * Page #112:
   > The Justice Department claimed that it was interested in commercialized sex, that for the most part it left alone the amateurs at the debauchery game— that is, people like Caminetti and Diggs. But the record shows otherwise. All sorts of cases were tried in the courts, cases which ranged ''from seduction and betrayal,  to  casual  romantic  trips,  to  serious  relationships  of  living  together.'' From  1922  to  1937  the  fbi  looked  into  50,500  alleged  violations  of  the  Mann Act. Many of the investigations started with complaints sent in by busybodies, people  with  grudges,  outraged  husbands,  wives,  parents,  and  miscellaneous others.  For  example,  a  woman  calling  herself  ''a  mother''  sent  a  letter  to  the Department  of  Justice  from  West  Palm  Beach  in  1927,  in  which  she  claimed ''There is a J.S. Nouser liveing at 727 Kanuga drive with a woman that he not married to and they was on a trip this summer to california and new York they stoped at the pennsylvania Hotel in new york as man and wife.''π∫

 * Page #112:
   > The Mann Act was applied to women, too, if they violated the sexual code; a study of women in federal prison between 1927 and 1937 found that about a quarter of the Mann Act violators were simply unmarried women who dared to travel about with married men. Scandalized and angry wives sometimes blew the whistle  on  their  husbands.πΩ  More  sinister  was  the  prosecution  of  the  black boxer Jack Johnson, whose sex life crossed the state line and the color line. He was tried in 1913 and sentenced to prison. The rock-and-roll singer Chuck Berry was sent to prison similarly in 1960; and Charlie Chaplin, whose real sin was his leftist leanings, was tried but acquitted in 1943.∫≠ Critics had warned that the Mann Act was a fertile breeding ground for blackmail. Sure enough, in January 1916 detectives arrested a gang of alleged Mann Act blackmailers. These men supposedly would ''shadow'' rich men, following them across state lines with their girlfriends. They would then confront the men, claim to be United States marshals, and demand payo√s. Sometimes the gang ''employed . . . attractive women  to  assist  in  creating  evidence.''∫∞  The  victims,  naturally  enough,  were reluctant to step forward.

 * Page #112:
   > The Mann Act was only the most notorious of the laws that broadened the war  against  illicit  sex.  Since  the  1870s  it  had  been  a  federal  crime  to  send obscene stu√ through the mail—and anything to do with contraception was by

 * Page #113:
   > definition obscene. Under some state laws, too, contraception itself was taboo: in  Connecticut  it  was  a  crime  to  use  any  ''drug,  medicinal  article,  or  instrument'' for this purpose.∫≤

 * Page #113:
   > Obscenity itself was, of course, outlawed almost everywhere; and, according  to  some  statutes,  so  was  anything  that  was  indecent,  impure,  or  likely  to corrupt  the  young.  Connecticut  added  a  ban  on  any  printed  stu√,  including newspapers, which might be ''devoted to the publication of . . . criminal news, police reports or pictures, and stories of deeds of bloodshed, lust or crime.''∫≥ Kentucky  had  a  similar  statute,  and  added  a  ban  on  printed  material  whose ''principal characteristic is to depict by illustrations men and women inflamed by  alcoholic  beverages,  drugs,  or  stimulants.''∫∂  In  many  states,  it  was  also  at least a minor o√ense to use indecent language in public.

   > Of  course,  Prohibition  did  not  come  out  of  the  blue.Ω∞  There  had  been a strong temperance movement in the nineteenth century. The movement had its ups and down, but it won some notable successes; and a number of states were already legally dry by 1900—North and South Dakota, Kansas and Iowa, Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire. The Anti-Saloon League, founded in the late nineteenth century, was a powerful and tireless lobbying group. By the early twentieth century, it had branches in almost all of the states. The league had strong allies among American Protestant churches. It worked to get ''dry'' laws passed at the local level, then at the state level; and, finally, to achieve the impossible dream, national prohibition.

 * Page #117:
   > In the end, Prohibition was a political failure—of this there can be no doubt at all. Millions hated it from the start, and the ranks of the wets gained more and

 * Page #118:
   > more political recruits as the decade dragged on. Looking back, we tend to see Prohibition as the last gasp of the dour anhedonic culture of old-line America. It  was  a  crusade  led  by  small-town,  solid,  respectable  Protestant  worthies.  It ''symbolized the superior power and prestige of the old middle class in American society.''∞≠∞ But this old middle class was, alas, swimming against the tide. The broader public, on the whole, saw nothing wrong with a nip or two, at least once in a while; or a glass of wine; or a friendly beer at home or in a tavern. The ''public'' here was Catholic and Jewish and ethnic, and it was closely allied to the big-city middle class. Prohibition was a fight between two cultural strains, and it is clear which one won out in the end.

 * Page #118:
   > Despite the enormous literature on Prohibition, there is a lot left to learn about enforcement on the ground. Most people who drank got away with it. Yet we  know  from  o≈cial  figures  that  there  were  thousands  and  thousands  of arrests and prosecutions. In 1920 the federal district courts had a caseload of 7,291  Prohibition  cases;  in  1930  the  numbers  had  gone  up  to  56,992.  To  be sure,  most  defendants  pleaded  guilty,  paid  a  fine,  and  went  home.  In  the Southern District of Texas, during the court term of February 1921 in Houston, there were twenty-three liquor cases; all of them paid fines except one man, who went to jail for six months.

 * Page #118:
   > Nobody was satisfied with the level of enforcement. For the wets it was too much;  they  told  horror  stories  of  abusive  enforcement,  and  of  what  almost amounted  to  warfare  between  agents  and  drinkers  and  suppliers.  The  exact figures  are  in  dispute,  but  a  newspaper  in  1929  estimated  that  some  1,360 people  had  been  killed,  and  another  thousand  wounded,  in  the  course  of enforcement of the laws.∞≠≥ Then there were the raids and the seizures in a vain attempt to end the flood of liquor pouring in from Canada, from home stills, from Caribbean ports, and from countless other sources. Yet for the dries, the rate of enforcement was far too low. By the end of the twenties, the smell of rot and decay was unmistakable. Prohibition was doomed. In 1929 President Hoover appointed a National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, the  so-called  Wickersham  Commission.  Among  other  things,  it  studied  the question of how to enforce Prohibition. But the commission's conclusions were weak and namby-pamby; it satisfied neither wets nor dries. Tougher enforcement was in fact impossible—politically, if for no other reason.

 * Page #118:
   > The  election  of  1932  sealed  the  fate  of  Prohibition.  The  Democratic

   > convention  adopted  a  plank  calling  for  the  repeal  of  the  Eighteenth  Amendment. Roosevelt won the election in a landslide, and in 1933 the states ratified the  Twenty-First  Amendment  to  the  Constitution,  which  sent  the  Eighteenth Amendment to an early grave. The ''noble experiment'' ended in failure.

 * Page #119:
   > The  first  quarter  of  the  twentieth  century  was  a  fateful  period,  too,  for  what became  the  war  on  drugs,  one  of  the  great  law-enforcement  disasters  of  the twentieth century. In the nineteenth century, neither drug tra≈cking nor addiction was, essentially, a criminal act. Not that anybody thought it was a good idea to be hooked on drugs; addiction was a disaster for most people, and almost everybody knew it. It was a slippery slope leading downward to complete ruin; it destroyed family life, smashed any hope of a meaningful career, and threatened  early  and  pitiful  death.  But  the  state  had  not  yet  wheeled  in  the  heavy artillery of criminal justice.

 * Page #120:
   > Long  after  Prohibition  itself  had  been  hooted  o√  the  stage,  the  ''war  on drugs''  has  continued;  over  the  years  it  has,  in  fact,  gotten  more  and  more violent and desperate. The punishments for violation have become stupefyingly

 * Page #121:
   > Every  generation,  it  seems,  has  its  own  theory  about  what  makes  people  do crimes, and why. Hardly anybody in 1900, say, believed that selling one's soul to the devil was an important source of criminality. They did, however, strongly believe  that  some  people  were  born  criminals;  that  crime  was  in  their  blood. These defective human beings constituted the new ''dangerous classes.'' It was not a new idea. It went back to the work of Cesare Lombroso in Italy in the late nineteenth century.∞∞∑ Lombroso's ideas had a kind of climax of acceptance in the  first  part  of  the  twentieth  century.  Henry  Goddard  in  1925  published  a sensational book about the ''Kallikak'' family (a fictitious name). Goddard was director of research at a New Jersey institution for the feeble-minded. He traced the genealogy of a whole crew of prostitutes, degenerates, and petty criminals; the line went back to ''Martin Kallikak,'' a soldier in the Revolutionary War, who fathered  a  bastard  child.  Kallikak  later  married  a  respectable  woman,  and produced  a  line  of  ''good''  people.  Thus  his  sex  life  set  in  motion  a  kind  of ''natural experiment.'' The laws that Gregor Mendel had discovered in his work on ''the ordinary garden pea'' also applied to human beings.

 * Page #121:
   > The  ideas  of  men  like  Goddard  seemed  to  have  wide  appeal.  As  Dr. William J. Hickens, director of the Psychopathic Laboratory of the Municipal Court of Chicago, put it in 1921, ''A cabbage will produce a cabbage and a rose a rose,  in  spite  of  all.''  He  pooh-poohed  the  idea  of  environmental  causes  of crime: ''moral defectiveness'' was the problem, nothing more. What could one expect from the likes of N.J., a male, aged twenty-one, a ''low grade moron,'' a ''hunchback,''  who  did  not  walk  or  talk  until  he  was  four,  a  ''heavy  cigarette smoker,'' with two arrests, seven stays in a mental institution, and two alcoholic aunts?∞∞π  Men  like  these  were  defectives,  they  would  inevitably  commit  antisocial acts; and (worst of all) would breed true.

 * Page #121:
   > The science of ''criminal anthropology'' rested on the notion that criminal types  betrayed  themselves  with  physical  signs.  As  late  as  the  1930s,  Earnest Hooton, after a ''nation-wide investigation of criminals,'' reported that criminals had ''relatively shorter and broader faces. . . . The nose is relatively shorter and

 * Page #122:
   > broader . . . ears with less roll of the helix or rim,'' along with ''stunted growth and  inferior  development.''∞∞∫  Other  experts  and  penologists  were  skeptical; Thomas  Mott  Osborne,  for  one,  sneered  at  the  notion  that  there  was  such  a thing  as  a  ''criminal  nose.''∞∞Ω  But  millions  of  people  believed  that  crime  was biological destiny. It was a curse of the blood.

 * Page #122:
   > Could anything be done about it? Leo Stanley, chief surgeon at San Quentin,  thought  he  could  improve  the  men  in  prison  with  glandular  tinkering. Between 1918 and 1940 he performed ten thousand ''testicular implantations.'' It seems that ''goldfish, fed on a diet of ground testicular substance from the ram,  increased  their  activity  by  four  hundred  per  cent  over  those  fed  on  .  .  . ordinary dried shrimp.'' Why should humans do any worse than goldfish? His subjects,  Stanley  thought,  became  more  active  and  energetic,  and  had  better appetites, after he had done his work.

 * Page #122:
   > Adding ''testicular implantations'' was much less popular than the idea of getting rid of these o√ensive organs altogether: cut o√ the rotten branches and keep them from propagating. If you believed in born criminals, it made perfect sense to stop ''perverts'' and the mentally defective from having babies, by hook or by crook. The nation, after all, was ''in danger of race degeneration because of  the  rapid  increase  in  the  ranks  of  the  defective,''  as  one  writer  put  it.∞≤∞ Indiana passed a pioneer sterilization law in 1907: the preamble declared that ''heredity plays a most important part in the transmission of crime, idiocy and imbecility.''∞≤≤ Any institution in the state which housed ''confirmed criminals, idiots, rapists and imbeciles'' was authorized to hire two ''skilled surgeons.'' If a ''committee  of  experts''  decided  that  ''procreation  was  in

 * Page #122:
   > California followed in 1909: its statute called for ''asexualization'' of convicts who had chalked up two sex crimes, or three serious crimes of any sort, and  any  convict  who  gave  ''evidence''  in  the  prison  that  ''he  is  a  moral  and sexual pervert.''∞≤≥ About half the states eventually had some sort of eugenics statute.∞≤∂ The Washington State statute required all state institutions to report those under their care who were ''feeble-minded, insane, epileptic,'' as well as ''habitual criminals, moral degenerates and sexual perverts,'' whose ''o√spring,'' because of the inheritance of ''inferior or anti-social traits,'' would likely become ''a social menace or wards of the state.'' These were then candidates for sterilization.∞

 * Page #122:
   > Some states were more enthusiastic than others about sterilizing. California

 * Page #123:
   > went about this dreary task with great gusto, especially for the ''feeble-minded''; 5,820 people had been operated on by 1929, a figure said to be four times as great as the total in the rest of the world.∞≤∏ Not everybody joined the chorus of praise  for  these  laws.  State  courts  struck  down  a  fair  number  of  them—for example,  New  Jersey,  in  a  1913  case  involving  an  epileptic  woman  in  a  state hospital—usually  on  the  grounds  that  they  inflicted  a  cruel,  degrading,  and humiliating punishment, and without due process.∞≤π In some ways, the high (or low) point of this movement was reached in Buck v. Bell, a Virginia case that brought  the  issue  before  the  United  States  Supreme  Court.∞≤∫  Carrie  Buck, described as a ''feeble minded white woman,'' was eighteen years old and lived in the State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble Minded. She was said to be the ''daughter of a feeble minded mother,'' and in turn the mother of an ''illegitimate feeble minded child.'

 * Page #123:
   > Oliver  Wendell  Holmes,  Jr.,  wrote  the  opinion;  and  it  is  one  of  his  most famous (or notorious). Holmes approved of the Virginia law, without hesitation; and he saw no constitutional barriers. After all, if the state could force children to be vaccinated (the Supreme Court had said so), and if it could force young men to die in battle, why should it not be able to order a woman to be sterilized? Sterilization here was fully justified. The eugenic nightmare of America demanded  radical  surgery.  ''Three  generations  of  imbeciles,''  Holmes  said, ''are enough.''

 * Page #123:
   > The  irony  is  that  what  Holmes  faced,  really,  was  no  generations  of  imbeciles at all. Neither Carrie Buck, nor her mother, nor her child (who died of measles in childhood) was actually retarded, as far as we know.∞≤Ω The child, in fact, had been considered quite bright. Hence the case was based on an appalling misconception. It was not three generations of imbeciles, but three generations of poor, inarticulate women; three generations of white trash, three generations  at  the  bottom  of  the  heap  in  society.  To  Holmes,  and  so  many  of  his contemporaries, the decision was progressive. From the standpoint of the year 2001,  Buck  v.  Bell  looks  entirely  di√erent.  It  seems  like  a  heartless  and  gratuitous  act  of  cruelty:  Carrie  Buck  and  her  daughter  were  innocent  victims, sacrificed on the altar of cultural and sexual hysteria.

   > A strong strain of nativism runs through American history. To be sure, Americans  have  always  thought  of  themselves  as  tolerant  people,  and  perhaps  they were, compared to others; but in the nineteenth century there were riots against the  Irish,  the  Mormons,  the  Catholics,  and  the  Chinese,  as  well  as  the  scandalous history of relations between black and white and between Native American and white. Nativism was quite strong at the end of the nineteenth century, and  in  the  first  part  of  the  twentieth.  We  mentioned  a  kind  of  cultural  panic among old-line Americans. On the West Coast, where most Asians lived, the Chinese were subject to all sorts of legal and social indignities. By law, they were not allowed to immigrate; and no Chinese person could become a naturalized citizen. Consular o≈cials in San Francisco and other ports rigorously enforced the anti-Chinese laws. They were also deeply skeptical of any Chinese person who knocked at the door of the port, claiming to be a citizen by birth. They considered these claims mostly false, and denied them by the hundreds. The Chinese who protested, and who got as far as the federal court system, occasionally won out. But the regulations grew tighter and tighter, until it was almost impossible for any claimant to wriggle through.∂

 * Page #135:
   > The legal system (and society) discriminated against Asians, but there were many  zigs  and  zags  in  the  process.  In  the  nineteenth  century,  for  example, Chinese children in San Francisco went to segregated schools; but segregation, southern-style,  did  not  flourish  in  California,  and  the  policy  lapsed  in  the twentieth century. As early as 1905 the San Francisco Board of Education gave up  the  idea  of  keeping  Chinese  students  out  of  ''white''  high  schools,  when Chinese  parents  threatened  a  boycott.  By  the  1940s  formal  segregation  no longer existed in the city.∂≥

   > Race prejudice on the West Coast was quite strong. It was not as pervasive and deadly as race relations in the American South; but it was bad enough. It carried with it strong overtones of economic rivalry, sexual paranoia, and the usual vague fears of dark, unmentionable evils that might destroy (as it were) America's precious bodily fluids. The Japanese, as one California newspaper put  it,  ''increase  like  rats.''∂∏  As  in  the  case  of  African-Americans,  marriage between races was verboten. For example, under Oregon law, no marriage could take  place  between  a  white  person  and  anyone  with  ''one-fourth  or  more''  of ''Mongolian blood.''∂π The land question was particularly touchy. Many of the Japanese had become farmers. In 1913 California passed a law to keep Asians from buying or owning land in the state.∂∫ A similar prohibition was embedded in  the  constitution  and  laws  of  Washington;  and  a  law  to  the  same  e√ect  was passed in Arizona in 1921.∂Ω Many of the Japanese, however, found ways to get around the Alien Land Law of 1913 in California. A law of 1920 closed many of the loopholes, and a law of 1923 was even more stringent.

   > Chinese exclusion laws constituted an early sign that the theory of the ''melting pot''  did  not  command  universal  respect.  The  melting-pot  metaphor  comes from the title of a play by Israel Zangwill (1908); Zangwill was himself a Jewish immigrant. America, he wrote, ''is God's crucible, the great Melting Pot where

 * Page #137:
   > all  the  races  of  Europe  are  melting  and  re-forming.''  He  added,  somewhat hyperbolically, ''Germans and Frenchmen, Irishmen and Englishmen, Jews and Russians—into the Crucible with you all! God is making the American.''∑≠

 * Page #137:
   > Zangwill's idea of the melting pot was not everybody's idea. Most Americans, though they may have agreed that the country was a melting pot, had a di√erent concept of what was supposed to melt and what would come out of the pot.  Their  notion  was  that  immigrants  should  become  real  Americans,  100 percent Americans, not ''hyphen-Americans''; immigrants were expected to get rid  entirely  of  their  old  ways,  and  adopt  the  language,  customs,  habits,  and manners of the older Americans. The Old World was nothing more than slag at the bottom of the pot.

 * Page #137:
   > Most immigrants found it hard enough to do the melting. For some groups, melting  was  just  plain  impossible—at  least  so  the  ''real''  Americans  thought. The  Chinese,  for  example,  were  (supposed  to  be)  so  di√erent,  so  exotic,  so through-and-through di√erent, that they would always remain undigested. This was one reason why the country was better o√ without them.

 * Page #137:
   > In addition, the Chinese and Japanese were considered economically dangerous. They worked for peanuts, it was said, and this threatened the standard of living of American workers. Huntington Wilson put it this way in 1914: ''We cannot maintain the wage scale of American labor and admit particularly cheap foreign  labor  any  more  than  one  can  maintain  two  connected  reservoirs  at di√erent levels.'' Wilson was also worried about ''races which tend to live apart in  groups  and  are  not  easily  assimilable  to  the  American  nation  in  blood, traditions, sympathies, and ideals.''∑∞

   > The  Chinese  failed  on  both  scores.  So  did  the  Japanese.  In  Ozawa  v. United  States  (1922)  the  question  was:  were  the  Japanese  eligible  to  become citizens? The answer depended on whether a Japanese could be a ''free white person.'' Ozawa's lawyer argued that the Japanese were ''white persons,'' who had ''Caucasian root stocks; a superior class, fit for citizenship''; and, moreover ''assimilable.''∑≤  But  the  Supreme  Court  was  not  buying  this  line;  in  their view,  the  Japanese  were  clearly  not  Caucasian.  Curiously  enough,  some  nonCaucasians  could  be  naturalized:  Africans,  and  persons  of  African  descent. This was because of constitutional amendments and statutes adopted after the Civil  War.  But  very  few  Africans  ever  applied;  and  American  blacks  did  not have to be naturalized; they were citizens by birth.

   > In  these  cases,  the  popular  idea  of  race  was  dominant.  An  Asian  was  an Asian. It was the popular (social) definition of black that prevailed as well—the ''one-drop'' rule is a rule not of science but of public opinion. Asians were not fit  for  the  melting  pot.  Other  groups,  presumably,  could  assimilate  (even  the ''dark-eyed, swarthy people of Alpine and Mediterranean stock''); but there was a limit to national tolerance of swarthiness.∑∏

 * Page #139:
   > There was also a growing fear that many new immigrants were choosing not to melt in the melting pot—they were living in private enclaves, in their little Italys and little Bohemias and little Polands. It was, after all, a time of troubles in the land—or at least, it felt that way. The frontier was closed, opportunities were shrinking, class war seemed to loom over the horizon. Nativism fed on these fears; and on the idea, or myth, that immigrants had no intention of giving up their foreign ways. This in itself seemed un-American. So was failure to speak English. In 1917 the state of Utah, hardly a hotbed of exotic foreigners, passed a statute to establish schools for ''Americanization.'' Every alien in Utah between the  ages  of  sixteen  and  forty-five  who  did  not  command  English  at  the  fifthgrade level had to attend an evening class ''for at least four hours a week'' during the normal term. The school districts were authorized (or required) to set up evening schools to teach ''English, the fundamental principles of the Constitution of the United States, American history, and such other subjects as bear on Americanization.''∑π

The records make clear that many administrators and consular o≈cials felt their job was to keep out the ri√ra√, at all costs. If a few mistakes were made, so be it.

Ju Toy (1905) a Chinese man, temporarily out of the country (he said), was stopped at the port of San Francisco.∑Ω Ju Toy claimed he was a citizen; the port o≈cials thought he was lying, and ordered him shipped back to China. Ju Toy protested; he appealed to the secretary of commerce and labor (immigration matters were in his jurisdiction). The secretary upheld the local  consular  o≈cial.  Ju  Toy  then  turned  to  the  federal  courts.  The  district court decided that Ju Toy was in fact a ''native-born citizen,'' and had a perfect right to stay. But the Supreme Court, speaking through Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., reversed the lower court. The decision of the secretary was absolutely final. Ju  Toy  had  no  right  to  a  ''judicial  trial,''  even  though  he  claimed  he  was  a

   > The rules of the game, in a case like Ju Toy's, were heavily tilted against the Chinese applicant. Justice Brewer, who dissented in Ju Toy, quoted from the immigration rules—the Chinese who claimed a right to enter was not allowed to get in touch with anybody, the examination was in private, totally controlled by the  immigration  o≈cer;  appeals  had  to  be  made  within  two  days,  and,  in  all cases, the ''burden of proof . . . rests upon Chinese persons claiming the right of admission''; in ''every doubtful case the benefit of the doubt shall be given by administrative o≈cers to the United States Government.''

   > In theory, the states had no power to decide questions of immigration; that was reserved to the federal government. But some states and local groups found ways  to  make  their  mark.  In  1898  in  New  Orleans,  a  group  of  408  Italian immigrants arrived on a French boat with the unlikely name of Britannia; the boat had sailed from Palermo, Sicily, by way of Marseille. Local o≈cials, playing  on  resentment  against  Italian  immigrants,  refused  to  allow  them  to  land. The excuse was the state's quarantine laws. The ship, its cargo, its crew, and its passengers all had a clean bill of health; but under Louisiana law, local boards of health  could  declare  the  immigrants  unwelcome,  because  New  Orleans  itself was full of noxious diseases. The Italians went to Pensacola, Florida, and the ship company went to court. That the board acted because its members wanted no  more  Italians,  and  not  because  of  any  valid  notion  of  hygiene,  seems  obvious, but the Supreme Court refused to intervene.∏∞

But  the  laws  were  modified  gradually,  in  state  after  state.  In

 * Page #244:
   > It burst into public view like a Roman candle on the Fourth of July. Alfred C. Kinsey was a biologist, whose early work was on gall wasps, not people. He intended his report on sexual behavior to be dry and objective; and to a certain extent it was—it bristled with charts, graphs, and  figures.  The  subject  was  sex;  but  the  treatment  was  humorless,  clinical; Kinsey reported, for example, with a perfectly straight face, statistical evidence on the angle of the penis when erect. (The average position, it seems, was ''very slightly above the horizontal,'' though some 8–10 percent ''carry the erect penis nearly vertically, more or less tightly against the belly'').∫Ω

 * Page #244:
   > The angle of the penis was not what Kinsey was after. He had a definite mission. He meant to unmask the hypocrisy of America's sex laws; these laws, he thought, were worse than futile; they were perverse. They made crimes out of behaviors that were rampantly common. Kinsey claimed that 59 percent of American men had ''some experience in mouth-genital contacts''; more than a third  had  had  ''some  homosexual  experience'';  as  many  as  17  percent  of  the ''farm boys'' had experimented with ''animal intercourse.'' All these acts were crimes—many, in fact, were grave crimes, infamous crimes, crimes that could get you years and years in prison, according to the various penal codes. In fact, Kinsey said, 95 percent of ''the total male population'' had committed one or more of these statutory crimes. All of these men were technically ''sex o√enders''; they could all, in theory, sit in prison, guarded by the 5 percent of the male population at large who were innocent of such crimes. His follow-up book, on the sexual behavior of women, was less shocking only because it came after the book about men, and was therefore not such a surprise. American women were not as wildly criminal as American men; but they were bad enough.Ω≠

Its methodology was analyzed and criticized and ripped to shreds; the data were drawn  (it  was  said)  from  weirdly  unrepresentative  samples.  Did  the  Kinsey report get the facts right, after all? Probably not—at least not totally; some of its statistics have failed to stand the test of time. But the essential message was far more important than the statistics; and this message really hit home.

   > most  states,  fornication  disappeared  from  the  penal  code.  In  New  Jersey  the state supreme court declared the fornication law unconstitutional—as a gross intrusion  on  ''personal  autonomy.''  An  expert  witness,  Dr.  Richard  Green, testified that the sex drive was ''central'' to ''personality development''; repression could lead to dreadful consequences—guilt, anxiety, ''inability to achieve erection'' in males, and ''frigidity'' or ''painful intercourse'' in women.Ω∞

   > In some states, adultery went into the legal trash heap along with fornication; and in a number of states, including California and Illinois, after the penal codes  were  housecleaned  and  reformed,  any  sexual  relations  between  that randy  pair,  ''two  consenting  adults,''  no  matter  what  these  relations  were,  or how they were, or who the parties were (same sex or opposite sexes), carried no penal sanction whatsoever. Kinsey's dream had come true. The Mann Act, too, traveled  down  the  road  to  oblivion.  As  late  as  the  1940s  the  government  had used the law to sensational e√ect against no less a celebrity than Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin had gotten involved with a young woman named Joan Barry; they quarreled and split up; she brought a paternity action against him (blood tests cleared Chaplin), and was later the complaining ''victim'' in a Mann Act case. Chaplin, it was alleged, paid her to go to New York and have sex with him.Ω≤ The evil genius behind this far-fetched case was J. Edgar Hoover, who considered Chaplin a dangerous radical. Chaplin was acquitted. The Mann Act was now  slowly  dying.  By  the  end  of  the  1960s,  there  were  only  a  handful  of convictions.  In  1978  and  1986  the  law  was  drastically  amended;  ''white  slavery''  and  ''debauchery''  disappeared  from  the  text;  the  act  became  unisex; and the crime was redefined. Now it consisted only of transporting for purposes of ''prostitution,'' or ''any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with  a  criminal  o√ense.''  This  meant,  for  example,  that  crossing  over  into Nevada from California, for ordinary lust and consummation, was no longer an illegal act.Ω≥

Most respectable people firmly believed (or said they believed) that pornography  was  sinful,  disgusting,  and  a  danger  to  society.  Hardly  any  one questioned  the  idea  that  pornography  and  obscenity  were  beyond  the  pale. States  and  cities  had  a  perfect  right  to  regulate,  control,  and  ban  all  forms of  ''dirt.''  Free  speech  stopped  at  the  border  of  naked  bodies  doing  their naked thing.

Of course, the nra and  its  fellow  travelers  do  not  really  care  about  ''original  intent''  (what  the Constitution meant to the men who wrote it), any more than prochoice people or gay rights advocates really care.

In 1982 a California law defined consent as ''positive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will.''∞∑Ω A striking New Jersey case (1992) held that any ''act of sexual penetration'' is a ''sexual assault'' unless there is ''a≈rmative and freely-given permission.''∞∏≠  Most  courts,  however,  have  been  very  reluctant  to  hold  flatly  and absolutely that no means no. To do so would make sexual intercourse a serious crime unless there was a strong and eager yes.

   > That  rape  is  a  serious  problem  hardly  anybody  questions.  The  most  serious  and  dangerous  crimes  are  acts  that  take  ''normal''  behavior,  accepted behavior,  and  push  it  beyond  an  invisible  line.  Society  allows  competition, aggressiveness, strength, forcefulness, ambition; these are highly valued traits, highly  rewarded.  Society  punishes  fraud  and  assault  because  they  cross  the invisible  line  into  forbidden  territory.  Sexual  etiquette,  historically,  called  for men  to  take  the  lead.  Men  asked  women  out  on  dates;  women  waited  to  be asked. Men proposed, women said yes or no. Moreover, men were supposed to be  always  hungry  for  sex,  always  seething  with  lust,  while  women  were  supposed  to  be  coy  and  resistant;  and  to  have  much  less  appetite  for  sex.  One prosecutor in Michigan put it this way, in 1980: ''I feel that there's an obligation for  healthy  males  to  do  whatever  they  can  with  every  girl  they  come  across.'' This behavior, he felt, was acceptable so long as the ''healthy male'' didn't get too  ''physical.''∞∏≥  Men  like  this  are  unlikely  to  change  their  behavior  toward women until they change their attitudes. And because the living law of rape and sexual assault closely tracks the attitudes of men (and women), it will change only if and when these attitudes change.

Only  a  lunatic  fringe  would  want  to  go  back  to  a  system  of segregated schools—at least legally segregated schools. But there is still some controversy  over  Brown  itself.  How  much  impact  did  the  case  actually  have? The border states moved quickly to implement the decision; but the South, as we have seen, resisted tooth and nail. Ten years after Brown, only 1.2 percent of black  schoolchildren  in  southern  states  went  to  schools  with  white  children.

On the other side, some say that Brown itself was ine√ective—as we have seen, very little actual desegregation of schools took place for years and years. Only the Civil Rights Acts (of 1964) broke the logjam. Worse yet (so the argument goes), Brown polarized the country, created a tremendous backlash, and may have even retarded the civil rights cause.≥π There was, in fact, what Michael Klarman has called a ''dramatic rightward  lurch''  in  southern  politics—and  Brown  may  well  be  one  of  the causes. The fuss over Brown, he argues, masks evidence of real progress toward moderation  in  the  South  taking  place  before  Brown;  moreover,  the  Supreme Court did not give birth to the civil rights movement; the movement was alive and well long before Brown.

 * Page #306:
   > There was, indeed, some progress before Brown. But it was wrung from bitter,  intransigent,  and  often  violent  white  opposition.  When  a  shipyard  in Mobile, Alabama, dared to hire twelve black welders during the Second World War, white workers assaulted them with bricks, hammers, wrenches, and crowbars.≥∫ This is not much in the way of progress. There was, to be sure, some countervailing evidence: President Harry S. Truman issued an order abolishing segregation  in  the  armed  forces  after  the  war,  and  some  elements  of  show business and sports were slowly integrating. Perhaps Brown did fan the flames of  hatred  in  the  South.  But  southern  white  fury  and  violence,  beamed  to  the whole country on TV, horrified millions of people in the North. They watched police  dogs  with  dripping  fangs  attacking  demonstrators,  tiny  girls  in  neat dresses  walking  to  school  while  howling  mobs  shrieked  and  spit  on  them, young people and religious leaders beaten with clubs. Thus TV was a major ally of the civil rights movement, just as it was to be a major ally of the antiwar movement  during  the  conflict  in  Vietnam.  And  the  change  in  the  climate  of opinion—mostly,  but  not  entirely,  in  the  North—set  in  motion  a  process  that ended with a ''national commitment'' to bring Jim Crow to an end.≥Ω

   > But  racism  and  white  supremacy  were  not  easily  killed.  The  southern system was like some primitive beast, a crawling, creeping creature low on the scale of evolution, growing new bodies from old ones that had been hacked to bits.  And  the  white  South  had  power:  it  was  in  almost  total  control  of  the machinery of southern states. There were forces which, as we have seen, were willing to play very rough. The main tactic of the South, as far as schools were concerned, was simply to do nothing. Delay, evade, dither; force the naacp and its allies, and the federal government if necessary, to spend time, money, e√ort, on every school district, in every state; make it prohibitively costly and slow to shoehorn  each  black  student  into  a  white  school  or  college.  Integration  thus proceeded in the Deep South at a snail's pace. Finally, the Supreme Court itself showed  impatience.  The  original  Brown  decision  had  called  for  integration ''with all deliberate speed''; but for ten years, said the Court in Gri≈n v. County School  Board (1964), there had been ''entirely too much deliberation and not enough  speed.''∂≥  The  case  arose  out  of  Virginia,  which  had  a  strategy  of ''massive resistance.''∂∂ In Gri≈n, Prince Edward County, Virginia, had tried to dodge  integration  by  a  simple,  brutal  move:  it  closed  down  all  the  public schools. The blacks were left with nothing; the whites went to private schools, hastily  cobbled  together  and  supported  by  state  grants  of  tuition.  The  Court held this plan unconstitutional.

 * Page #308:
   > In the end, ''massive resistance'' proved to be futile, and it collapsed under the  pressure  of  politics  and  court  orders.  Nonetheless,  in  most  cities  of  the South,  integration  came  grinding  to  a  halt.  What  killed  school  integration  in the end was not segregationism and its tricks, but simply white flight. Segregation  in  housing  doomed  integration  in  schooling.  In  Swann  v.  CharlotteMecklenburg  Board  of  Education  (1970),  the  Supreme  Court  put  its  stamp  of approval  on  a  plan  to  disperse  the  black  students  of  Charlotte,  North  Carolina.∂∑  The  plan  involved  putting  kids  on  buses  and  sending  them  here  and there, so that the ratio of blacks to whites would be the same all over Charlotte. The decision was unanimous, but there was heated disagreement behind the scenes, which the decision papered over. Swann was not the first, or the last, battle over busing. In general, busing was desperately unpopular among whites in city after city. Swann came out of North Carolina; but this was no longer a southern problem or a southern issue. In few places was the school bus a more explosive topic than in Boston, in the heart of Yankee country. Massachusetts had passed a Racial Imbalance Act in 1965; but attempts to use school buses to

   > In  truth,  the  North  now  had  to  confront  its  own  dark  and  dirty  secrets. Northern  schools  were  not  segregated  by  law—at  least  not  openly.  But  they were segregated in fact. Northern prejudice was more subtle and less violent, on the  whole,  than  southern  prejudice;  but  it  was  stubborn,  deeply  rooted,  and pervasive. Of course, in Mississippi, not a single black child attended school with  white  children  in  the  1950s,  and  this  was  never  true  of  New  York  or Chicago  or  Denver.  But  the  vast  majority  of  black  students  in  the  North  and West went to schools that were all black; and the vast majority of whites went to schools  that  were  entirely  white.  The  issue,  then,  was  the  issue  of  de  facto segregation.  The  lawsuits  were  not  long  in  coming.  The  first  to  reach  the Supreme Court, in 1973, came out of Denver—a city far from the Deep South, in  a  state  that  had  never  had  a  policy  of  segregated  schools.∂π  It  had,  in  fact, banned  racial  discrimination  for  decades.  But  the  school  board  had  gerrymandered  school  districts  and  manipulated  boundaries—enough  so  that  the Supreme  Court  was  able  to  find  an  intent  to  discriminate,  and  it  held  Denver responsible.

   > The Supreme Court, up to this point, had never shown much interest in gender issues. In a 1961 case out of Florida, a woman was tried for smashing her husband's  head  with  a  baseball  bat.  The  jury—twelve  men—convicted  her. Women  were  eligible  for  jury  duty  in  Florida,  but  they  served  only  if  they wanted to serve, and only if they signed up for service, which few of them did. The Supreme Court saw nothing wrong with this law, constitutionally speaking. After all, despite a certain amount of ''enlightened emancipation,'' women were still  ''the  center  of  home  and  family  life'';  and  unless  the  women  themselves stepped up and volunteered, a state was entitled to decide that women ''should be relieved from the civic duty of jury service''—presumably so that they could do their all-important home thing.π≥

It  found,  hidden  deep  inside  the  Fourteenth Amendment, where nobody had been able to see it before, a principle that made sex discrimination unconstitutional. To be sure, the men (and they were, of course, all men) who wrote the words of the Fourteenth Amendment almost  certainly  had  no  such  thing  in  mind—certainly  not  equal  rights  for women. After all, women in 1868 did not vote, serve on juries, or hold o≈ce.

Any  law  that discriminated  against  blacks  faced  ''strict  scrutiny''  in  the  Supreme  Court, which  meant  it  was  almost  certainly  doomed.  Gender  faced  a  somewhat  less beady eye: ''intermediate'' scrutiny. Tons of paper and oceans of legal ink have been spent in arguments about these levels of scrutiny. Much of this seems like arid  hairsplitting.  But  underneath  the  verbal  arguments  is  a  genuine  dispute. Civil rights law aimed to obliterate all legal distinctions based on race. There are no  real  di√erences  between  the  races—nothing  that  would  justify  a  law  that would draw the race line. But no such theory could be applied quite so rigorously to gender: men and woman are di√erent; and the di√erences may be such as to justify some di√erences in treatment, in custom or law.

   > The decision rested, in part, on rather murky premises; and the Court later backed  o√  with  regard  to  some  of  them.πΩ  But  the  Court  did  show  a  certain sensitivity to women's position in society. The ''constitutionally protected freedom'' mentioned was the freedom to get pregnant and have a baby. Why did Cleveland,  and  the  other  districts,  adopt  these  rules  in  the  first  place?  The school boards talked publicly about the health of the women and continuity of instruction;  in  private,  they  talked  about  ''giggling  schoolchildren,''  and  the need to get the teachers out of the classroom before they ''began to show,'' when

   > the  kids  would  say  that  ''teacher  swallowed  a  watermelon,  things  like  that.'' Thus,  ultimately,  the  case  was  about  the  intersection  between  sexuality  and gender;  and  the  Court  was  really  taking  a  stand  against  what  it  considered Victorian prudery.

   > Another troublesome case was Michael M. v. Superior Court (1981).∫≤ Here the Court confronted a California law on statutory rape. As we have seen, a male who has intercourse with an underage girl commits this crime, even if the girl says  yes,  even  if  she  positively  lusted  after  him;  and  even  if  he  himself  was underage—which, in fact, Michael M. was. This would seem, in the context of the 1980s, a pretty clear instance of sex discrimination—and one which rested on ancient stereotypes to boot. The Court, however, upheld the law. It saw a plain  di√erence  here:  she  could  get  pregnant;  he  could  not.  That,  they  felt, justified  the  di√erence  in  the  statute.  Here  too  the  legislature  stepped  in  and changed  the  law.  ''Statutory  rape''  is  now  ''unlawful  sexual  intercourse.''  The statute is unisex. And the sex is criminal only if one of the two is very young, or if one is a minor, and the other is more than three years older.∫≥

   > Finally, in Rostker  v.  Goldberg (1982), the Court came face to face with a thorny issue: whether women could fight and die for their country.∫∂ Young men, but not young women, had to register for the draft. But this was acceptable, said the Court, because women were not ''eligible for combat''—a point on which all the  justices  agreed.  Why  were  women,  in  fact,  less  fit  to  shoot  a  bazooka,  or throw ta hand grenade, than to be on the police force, or fight fire, or mine coal,

   > There were many sex discrimination cases, most of them rather ordinary cases of bias in the workplace. Bias here too learned how to disguise itself. Thus the Griggs doctrine could be, and was, used in sex discrimination cases. Dianne Rawlinson wanted to be a prison guard in an all-male Alabama prison. Alabama wanted its prison guards to stand tall: they had to be more than five feet, two inches  in  height;  they  also  had  to  weigh  more  than  120  pounds.  The  weight requirement would exclude 22 percent of the women but only 2 percent of the men;  the  height  requirement  would  exclude  a  third  of  the  women  and  only 2 percent of the men. The Supreme Court struck down these requirements in 1977—Dianne, however, lost her case on other grounds.∫∑

   > The eeoc had jurisdiction over sex discrimination cases. In the very first year of its existence, more than two thousand complaints were filed under this heading.  Complaints  and  lawsuits  have  kept  on  growing.  In  the  1990s  the number of complaints reached twenty thousand a year or more. Most of them died  at  the  agency,  presumably  because  they  were  groundless  (at  least  in  the judgment of the eeoc). In fiscal 1995 the eeoc found ''reasonable cause'' in only 2.3  percent  of  the  complaints;  a  small  number  in  addition  were  successfully ''conciliated'' or settled.∫∏

   > Most claimants, then, got nowhere; but there were so many who tried that even  the  small  percentage  of  surviving  suits  and  administrative  actions  were enough  to  erect  a  vast,  ballooning  body  of  law  on  sex  discrimination  in  the workplace. Sex cases were not like race cases in one key legal regard. A business could turn down a woman (or a man) for a job if gender was a ''bona fide occupational qualification,'' or bfoq. There was no such exception in race cases. A theater looking for somebody to play Hamlet could presumably pass up women who  applied  for  the  job.  In  other  regards,  the  court  read  this  exception  very narrowly. In Diaz v. Pan American (1971), a man, Celio Díaz, Jr., wanted a job as an airline flight attendant. All domestic flight attendants were women (''stewardesses''). Pan American claimed that customers preferred women; the airline brought  in  a  psychiatrist  as  an  expert  witness.  This  expert,  Dr.  Eric  Berne (author  of  The  Structure  and  Dynamics  of  Organizations  and  Groups)  explained  why  women  were  better  at  the  job:  an  airplane,  he  said,  is  a  ''sealed enclave,'' an ''enclosed and limited space,'' in which people su√er the ''unusual physical experience of being levitated o√ the ground . . . out of touch with their

   > accustomed world.'' Women would do better in this situation than men; male passengers ''would subconsciously resent a male flight attendant perceived as more  masculine  than  they.''∫π  The  trial  court  accepted  this  argument;  but  the appeal court reversed; this was not a legitimate bfoq.∫∫ In another case, brought against Southwest Airlines, the defendant, as Deborah Rhode has put it, ''presented  woman  as  temptress  rather  than  nurturer'';  the  airline's  ''sexy  image'' made women attendants in ''hot pants and high boots'' more desirable. But the ''flying bordello'' was as unsuccessful in court as the ''flying womb.''∫Ω Stewardesses passed into history, and flight attendants (of either sex) replaced them.

   > In these airline cases, men won the victory; but arguably, in a deeper sense, it was women who won. The cases tried to break down old stereotypes about women.  These  stereotypes  were  barriers  to  women,  in  the  job  market,  and elsewhere,  even  when  they  were  couched  in  flattering  terms,  and  were  supposed to benefit women in some way. The courts made it clear that employment ghettos, whether male or female, were no longer legally acceptable. To let men serve  co√ee  on  airplanes,  then,  was  a  step  toward  letting  women  do  brain surgery, ride in police cars—or, for that matter, serve as ceos of big corporations. Thus when the Court told the Mississippi University for Women in 1982 that it could not exclude men from its nursing school, women were entitled to cheer.Ω≠

This  has been defined as ''the imposition of unwelcome sexual demands or the creation of sexually o√ensive environments.''Ω∞ Women began bringing complaints about sexual harassment on the job in the 1970s; an important book by Catharine MacKinnon, published in 1979, discussed these complaints and made a powerful argument that harassment ought to be considered sex discrimination, and therefore prohibited by Title VII.Ω≤ In 1980 eeoc agreed, and defined sexual harassment as discrimination.

   > One group consisted of aliens. The Court, as we saw, had disapproved of the laws restricting land ownership by noncitizens. But these were racist laws, directed against the Japanese and other Asians. All sorts of other state laws, big and  small,  limited  the  rights  of  noncitizens.  Perhaps  the  most  extreme  were Pennsylvania's  game  laws  of  the  1920s;  under  these  laws,  no  ''unnaturalized foreign-born person'' could hunt birds or animals, possess ''a shotgun or rifle or  pistol  or  firearm''  or  even  a  ''dog  of  any  kind,  at  any  place  outside  of buildings.'' No alien could go fishing in Pennsylvania.∞≠∑ More commonly, states simply excluded aliens from state jobs.

   > Hugo Black wrote an angry dissent. Among other things, he argued that the ''original idea of schools'' was that ''children had not yet reached the point of experience and wisdom which enabled them to teach all of their elders.'' This idea was not ''worthless or out of date.'' Taxpayers send children to ''learn, not teach'';  and  he  decried  the  decline  of  school  discipline.  The  decision  would encourage students to ''defy their teachers''; and he painted a grim picture of rebellious students, ''already running loose, conducting break-ins, sit-ins, lieins, and smash-ins.''

   > Black's dissent can be dismissed as an old man's longing for some golden age;  as  the  angry  wails  of  a  onetime  liberal  icon,  marooned  in  a  raucous  and permissive culture, which had engulfed his standards of gentility and rationality. Yet Black had put his finger on the heart of the case. The case was not about free speech, in a sense: it was about discipline and authority. The lesser liberation movements—students, prisoners, aliens, for example—were not about discrimination in the same sense as the civil rights movement; they were indeed about discipline and authority. And they were signs of deep change, for better or for worse, in the culture of discipline and authority—signs of a steep decline in the vertical power of teachers, parents, and leaders in general.

   > It  is  easy  to  forget  that  millions  of  Americans—during  wartime,  tens  of  millions—fall under another, special legal system—the system of military justice.∞≤≤ The Articles of War, on British models, were in e√ect from 1776 on. Military justice  always  had  something  of  a  kangaroo  court  aspect;  army  commanders, and ship captains, had enormous, almost unrestrained power to discipline their men. War is cruel and tough, and this power was supposed to be necessary. But the long-term trend has been toward granting more rights, more due process, to servicemen and -women. The process began after the First World War. After the Second World War, the Department of Defense set up a committee, with orders to draft a Uniform Code of Military Justice. The ucmj went into e√ect in 1951. The code created a United States Court of Military Appeals—a court made up of o≈cers, but structurally independent; a court which was not to be cowed and controlled by commanding generals and admirals. Essentially, under the code, men and women accused of crimes against the military code had many of the same constitutional rights as civilians.

   > At  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century,  some  of  the  first  nations  showed  a strength no one would have predicted in 1900. The march toward extinction had halted. True, native culture was under siege. Some small tribes were not likely to survive. Dozens of native languages were either extinct, or spoken only by  a  few  old  women  and  men.  Assimilation  was  still  an  ever-present  danger. The  threat  no  longer  came  from  a  cruel  and  indi√erent  government;  it  came from a more powerful and implacable enemy: American mass culture, TV, and the seductions of modernity. But the bigger tribes—the Navajo, the Cherokee— had  definitely  turned  a  corner.  Their  populations  were  growing.  Their  languages and religions seemed, for the moment, secure. A number of tribes, too, had been able to get out of the rut of poverty. Some tribes exploited valuable mineral rights; other exploited their sovereignty, by running casinos or selling fireworks in places where these businesses were otherwise illegal. Despite these

Like  the  black  farmworkers  of  the  South,  they  were despised but essential. The Chicano population of California grew rapidly in the  twentieth  century;  by  1927  nearly  10  percent  of  the  state's  public  school population was of Mexican descent—some sixty-five thousand pupils, concentrated in the southern part of the state.∞≥∫ As the population grew, school boards began to force Mexican kids into segregated schools. The city of San Bernardino went further: it barred people of ''Mexican or Latin descent'' from certain swimming pools, bathhouses, parks, and playgrounds. A federal court declared the practice unconstitutional in 1944.∞≥Ω

   > As the Near case shows, and the history of the ''yellow press'' in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century confirms, wild, irresponsible journalism is  nothing  new.  The  content  changes  somewhat  over  time.  Supermarket  tabloids, People magazine, and celebrity gossip vehicles are politically neutered and show  few  signs  of  race  hatred;  they  feed  on  the  vices  and  weaknesses  of  the ''stars'': heroes of stage, screen, radio, TV, and music; sports figures; political figures thrown in to the bargain only insofar as they qualify as celebrities. In the late twentieth century, the market for celebrity news had become voracious. In a way,  New  York  Times  v.  Sullivan,  a  case  of  somber  nobility,  a  shield  for  the brave and the virtuous against white supremacists and other racial predators, turned into a Magna Carta for the celebrity society—a society hungry for every last  crumb  of  gossip  and  dirt  about  famous  people.  Today,  legally  speaking, almost anything goes. The public, we are told, has a legitimate (and constitutional)  interest  in  everything—certainly  in  the  sex  life  of  President  William Je√erson Clinton, including the shape of his penis—and is entitled to know or hear about everybody of any significance, and even people of no significance, as long  as  their  lives  could  possibly  be  considered  ''public,''  during  their  proverbial fifteen minutes of fame. New York Times v. Sullivan, of course, did not create the raucous, intrusive, scandal-mad hunger for ''news.'' It did not create reality  TV  or  ''trash  talk  shows.''  And  if  the  cases  had  gone  in  some  other direction, that would probably not have been able to stop the explosion of morbid  curiosity.  This  was  inevitable  in  a  society  saturated  with  images  day  and night—images that give the illusion of reducing the social distance between the ordinary Joe and Jane, on the one hand, and the rhinestone glitter of celebrity life on the other; images that blur the line between fact and fiction, between truth and fantasy. The Sullivan case became one part of a mighty current of events.
