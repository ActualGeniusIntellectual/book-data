Trump and his sta\u0000 had reasonable, actionable indications from intelligence services and other sources that the armed force intended to use violence against the U.S. Government at Trump's direction, and that it had activated detailed plans to that end.

Despite knowing that some of his supporters are interpreting his tweet as a call for violence, Trump has repeatedly refused to communicate that they misinterpreted him. The honest judge must at least ask whether Trump has refused to clarify because the insurrectionists didn't misinterpret him at all.

He was disquali\u0000ed from the Senate as an insurrectionist either because he allowed his son to join the Confederate army (and gave him $100 for the road) when he might have as easily withheld that permission (and assistance) and/or because he opposed the Buchanan Administration's measures to suppress insurrection and defend national institutions and personnel. Through Thomas's case, Congress established a precedent that, yes, if you have the power to stop or signi\u0000cantly impede the insurrection, but refuse to exercise your power, without ample justi\u0000cation, then you become a participant in that insurrection. If Senator-Elect Thomas was disquali\u0000ed for simply arguing against the Buchanan Administration's (weak-kneed) e\u0000orts to defend against an anticipated insurrection (which was still months away), how much moreso would the 1867 Senate have disquali\u0000ed Donald Trump for successfully blocking far simpler and more e\u0000cacious defensive measures against an insurrection that was actively attacking the Capitol? They didn't need Trump to clap his son in chains (or send him o\u0000 starving); all they needed was for Trump to record a thirty-second video clip using the hot camera just down the hall!",

Mayor Bowser ended up not making the request, which, I think it's fair to say, turned out to be a big mistake. This is Trump's best evidence on his side, I think, which is probably why he yells about it (alongside several falsehoods) in his letter to the J6 Committee. I just don't think this evidence stands up against the other, better evidence on the other side of the question.",

(J95) It seems that Trump did \u0000oat the idea of having 10,000 National Guardsmen to protect his own rally (J534), and that military leaders were reluctant to become involved for fear that the President or others would politicize their involvement (J729-741).",

The \u0000rst element is easy because imminent violence was, in fact, the result of the speech; the second is made much easier by the existence of multiple eyewitnesses deeply loyal to Trump (and never renounced by him, even a\u0000er the insurrection!) who understood the speech itself to be a call to violence; which leaves only the third element, Trump's state of mind, which cannot be empirically known, but may be inferred from his prior and subsequent actions.",
